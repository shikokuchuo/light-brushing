I am a photographer.

I affirm this each morning by pointing my camera at the window and taking a photograph, nothing more than this.

Since February 2015 (ongoing).

```{r images, layout="l-body-outset"}

files <- list.files("windows")
selected <- sample(files, floor(runif(n = 1L, min = min, max = max + 1L)))

develop <- function(x) {
  plot(imager::load.image(file.path("windows", x)), axes = FALSE)
  paste0(" #", gsub(".jpg", " ", x, fixed = TRUE))
}

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
print(ichimoku::matrix_df(do.call(cbind, lapply(selected, develop))), row.names = FALSE)

```

```{r caption}

flen <- length(files)
slen <- length(selected)
msg <- sprintf("A random selection of %d %s sampled from %d photographs dating from Feb 2015\nto %s.",
               slen, if (slen == 1L) "window" else "windows", flen, date)
cat(msg)

he said.

“Photographs... are not just indexical because light happened to be recorded in an instant on a piece of photosensitive film, but because, first and foremost, they were taken.

    The very act of photography, as a kind of gesture,

which points to an event in the world, as a form of designation... is thus itself a form of indexicality.”
