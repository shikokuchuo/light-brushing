Created at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London, 2016.

This portfolio is formed of two books which

    explore photography as a performance art「Tsuki 月」, 

as well as a 

    documentation of Japanese and other space-times「Hanabi 花火」.

The books deal with concepts of universal identity and recognition.
