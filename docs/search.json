      "contents": "\r\nCharlie GaoCharlie Gao is an artist using photography as an unbounded and non-specific concept.\r\nWorks explore how photography may be interpreted in the widest sense, as a practice that is itself performative and continuous in nature, a lived-in experience which sustains long-term habit and ritual. In this sense it is the motivations behind the photographer which are necessarily of paramount interest, with the camera and image secondary, confounding traditional notions of photography.\r\nResiding in London and travelling regularly to Japan, the artist studied at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London, and holds an MA (Cantab) degree from Trinity College of the University of Cambridge.\r\n‚Äì\r\nContact\r\nE-mail: < charlie.gao using shikokuchuo.net >\r\n‚Äì\r\nTheory\r\nThe following text provides a skeleton theoretical framework underpinning the artist‚Äôs work and views on photography.\r\nüìÑ Exposing the light chamber: a note on photography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(2003):\r\n‚ÄúPhotographs‚Ä¶ are not just indexical because light happened to be recorded in an instant on a piece of photosensitive film, but because, first and foremost, they were taken.\r\nThe very act of photography, as a kind of gesture,\r\nwhich points to an event in the world, as a form of designation‚Ä¶ is thus itself a form of indexicality.‚Äù\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
