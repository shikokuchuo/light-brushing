      "contents": "\nSelf-portrait, Shikoku, Japan 2019Charlie Gao is an artist using photography as an unbounded and non-specific concept.\nWorks explore how photography may be interpreted in the widest sense, as a practice that is itself performative and continuous in nature, a lived-in experience which sustains long-term habit and ritual. In this sense it is the motivations behind the photographer which are necessarily of paramount interest, with the camera and image secondary, confounding traditional notions of photography.\nResiding in London and travelling regularly to Japan, the artist studied at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London, and holds an MA (Cantab) degree from Trinity College of the University of Cambridge.\n‚Äì\nContact\nE-mail: < charlie.gao using shikokuchuo.net >\n‚Äì\nTheory\nThe following text provides a skeleton theoretical framework underpinning the artist‚Äôs work and views on photography.\nüìÑ Exposing the light chamber: a note on photography\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe title refers to a theory of modern cosmology that provides an explanation for the coherence that we actually experience in everyday life despite the randomness implications of quantum mechanics.\nAkin to theories where infinite possible worlds branch out at each point in time, this theory instead posits that our history itself changes at each point in time.\nAlluding to this concept, I scan the ends of the 35mm roll film used to create my other works.\nThere being no referent, it is only the pure intent of the photographer which is present.\nMultiple Histories - Tsuki EditionThis special arrangement was originally created for the photobook Tsuki, published 2016.\nAlthough the title for this piece may now have acquired political connotations given the spread of ‚Äòfake news‚Äô, with multiple narratives competing on the global stage on any number of issues, this was not something that would have been so readily apparent at the time.\n\n\n\n",
