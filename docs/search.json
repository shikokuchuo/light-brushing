      "contents": "\nSelf-portrait, Shikoku, Japan\n2019Charlie Gao is an artist using photography as an unbounded and\nnon-specific concept.\nWorks explore how photography may be interpreted in the widest sense,\nas a practice that is itself performative and continuous in nature, a\nlived-in experience which sustains long-term habit and ritual. In this\nsense it is the motivations behind the photographer which are\nnecessarily of paramount interest, with the camera and image secondary,\nconfounding traditional notions of photography.\nResiding in London and travelling regularly to Japan, the artist\nstudied at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London, and\nholds an MA (Cantab) degree from Trinity College of the University of\nCambridge.\n–\nContact\nE-mail: < charlie.gao using shikokuchuo.net >\n–\nTheory\nThe following text provides a skeleton theoretical framework\nunderpinning the artist’s work and views on photography.\n📄\nExposing the light chamber: a note on photography\n\n\n\n",
